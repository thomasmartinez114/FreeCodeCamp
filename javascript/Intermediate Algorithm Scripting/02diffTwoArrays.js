// Diff Two Arrays
// Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

// Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

// Note
// You can return the array with its elements in any order.
