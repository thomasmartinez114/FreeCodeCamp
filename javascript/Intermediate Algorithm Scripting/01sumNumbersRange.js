// Sum All Numbers in a Range

// We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them.

// The lowest number will not always come first.

// Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
